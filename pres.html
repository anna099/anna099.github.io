    <h1 id="slide-1">Slide 1</h1>
    <p>The book is an investigation into modern biopolitics, and an attempted development from Foucault’s work.</p>
    <p>The picture on this slide depicts a man made up of animals, which will later become relevant - (bios and zoe).</p>
    <h1 id="slide-2">Slide 2</h1>
    <h1 id="slide-3">Slide 3</h1>
    <p>The homo sacer can be understood as an ‘enemy’ in Schmitt’s sense: an outsider, an absence that is required for the smooth running of the system as a whole.</p>
    <p>The concepts of bios and zoe first appeared in Aristotle. They allow us to interpret the picture on the first slide.</p>
    <h1 id="slide-4">Slide 4</h1>
    <p>Agamben notes that in Hobbes’s <em>De Cive</em>, it is the body’s capacity to be killed that serves as the foudnation of political equality.</p>
    <p>But Agamben is not Hobbes: he is not merely interested in a historical situation where ‘every man is Enemy to every man’;</p>
    <p>instead, he is interested in the mdoern phenomenon whereby ‘whole victim groups are made available to misuse by being categorised out of the body politic’.</p>
    <h1 id="slide-5">Slide 5</h1>
    <p>His understanding of totalitarianism makes him stronger than Foucault.</p>
    <p>Page 120, Agamben argues that Arendt’s work did not fully realise the implications of biopower.</p>
    <p>Foucault’s work, on the other hand, couldn’t comprehend how modern democracy could turn into totalitarianism.</p>
    <p>Nazi propaganda: <em>Lebensunwertes Leben</em> (life unworthy of life)</p>
    <p>Here, Agamben is comparable to Adorno and Horkheimer, for whom the Holocaust was not an <em>excpetion</em>, but the logical or dialectical outcome of modernity.</p>
    <h1 id="slide-6">Slide 6</h1>
    <p>Agamben and Pasolini knew each other; Agamben starred in one of Pasolini’s films.</p>
